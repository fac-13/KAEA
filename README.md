# KAEA
This project was built using React, the game requires you guess the definition of a word to increase your score.

This quiz uses [Wordnik](https://developer.wordnik.com/) API.

It explores the meanings of **long** words (minimal length of each word is 8 characters).

A word will be given to you along with 4 definitions.

You need to choose the right definition and click the submit button.

You will see your score increase (if you chose right) or drop to **zero** (if you chose the wrong answer).

The game is infinite, close it whenever you want.
